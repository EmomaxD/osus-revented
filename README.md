# osus-revented
The sussy osu clone named osus, revamped!


To build the game you only need the basic tools installed:

-> GCC and G++ (and also MinGW variants for the windows builds)

-> Make

-> CMake



To actually build the game follow the steps below:

1 - run ```git submodule update --init```

2 - create a directory called "build"

3 - "patch" the raylib library with the provided sources

4 - run ```./linuxmakeall.sh``` or ```./windowsmakeall.sh```


When you just want to run the game, use ```./linuxmakefast``` or ```./windowsmakefast.sh```, or just move the executable to the parent directory and just run it like every other binary executable!


Expect to see many bugs and slowdowns, as this is a "Work In Progress" project, but we hope that we can make it better and for that we need your support!

When you encounter a bug, or see something missing, just report it using the "Issues" tab on github! We will check the issue as fast as we can and we will try to fix it :D
